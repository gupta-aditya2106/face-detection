 Detect Face and Eyes

This project utilizes Haar cascades, a machine learning-based approach, for facial detection and recognition. Haar cascades are a popular method for object detection in images, particularly known for their efficiency in detecting faces. They work by identifying features like edges, corners, and textures within an image.

# Features
**1. Facial Detection**
Utilizes pre-trained Haar cascades to detect faces within images or video frames.
Draws rectangles around detected faces for easy visualization.
**2. Eye Detection**
Detects eyes within detected faces using a cascade classifier specifically trained for eye detection.
Draws rectangles around detected eyes to highlight their positions.
**3. Webcam Support**
Can capture and process real-time video feed from the webcam.
Displays the processed video with rectangles around detected faces and eyes.
**4. Image Processing**
Supports processing of images from files.
Reads images, detects faces, and displays the processed images with rectangles around detected faces and eyes.
**5. User Interaction**
Offers a user-friendly interface for choosing between webcam feed and image processing modes.
Provides options to start processing the webcam feed or select an image file for processing.
