 Detect Face and Eyes

This project utilizes Haar cascades, a machine learning-based approach, for facial detection and recognition. Haar cascades are a popular method for object detection in images, particularly known for their efficiency in detecting faces. They work by identifying features like edges, corners, and textures within an image.

# Features

**1. Facial Detection**

Utilizes pre-trained Haar cascades to detect faces within images or video frames.

Draws rectangles around detected faces for easy visualization.

**2. Eye Detection**

Detects eyes within detected faces using a cascade classifier specifically trained for eye detection.

Draws rectangles around detected eyes to highlight their positions.

**3. Webcam Support**

Can capture and process real-time video feed from the webcam.

Displays the processed video with rectangles around detected faces and eyes.

**4. Image Processing**

Supports processing of images from files.

Reads images, detects faces, and displays the processed images with rectangles around detected faces and eyes.

**5. User Interaction**

Offers a user-friendly interface for choosing between webcam feed and image processing modes.

Provides options to start processing the webcam feed or select an image file for processing.
